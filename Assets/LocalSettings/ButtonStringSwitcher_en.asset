      During gameplay,
      the colored buttons will flash in a sequence. Watch carefully, wait until the
      entire sequence is complete, then repeat the exact same order by pressing the
      buttons. The game gets more challenging after each successful round, with increasingly
      longer sequences to remember.

      How far can you go? Press the Start button
      and find out!'
